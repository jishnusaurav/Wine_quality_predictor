# Wine_quality_predictor
Predicts the quality of wine
This is a machine learning project in python that predicts the quality of wine on the basis of some characteristics of the wine like the sulphur content, pH etc. This is a basic Machine learning project in python that uses inear regression to make the prediction. 

**Requirements**

The basic requirements to run this program are:

=>Python 3.6.9

=>numpy-1.18.2

=>scikit-learn-0.22.2

=>scipy-1.4.1

=>pandas  

=>matplotlib

**Description**

The dataset that we use for this program has a lot of data samples of Red Wine with the required characteristics.

**Working**

The program takes the dataset using the numpy library function. We split the dataset into training and testing parts for the respective purposes. We then train our model using linear regression and then we predict the quality and give the output.

The data set is available here.
